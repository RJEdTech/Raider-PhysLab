   "title": "Where the energy goes",
   "html": "A car turns stored energy (chemical energy in fuel, or electrical energy in a battery) into kinetic energy. Energy is conserved, but not all of it becomes motion: an engine turns most of the fuel's energy into heat, while an electric motor turns most of the battery's energy into motion. Efficiency = useful energy out &divide; energy in. Fewer engines means fewer grams of tailpipe CO<sub>2</sub> per km."
